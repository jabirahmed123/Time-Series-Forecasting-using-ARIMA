```{r setup, include=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(fpp2, ggplot2, reportr, tibble)
theme_set(theme_classic())
murders <- as_tibble(wmurders)
```
```{r}
# Originial time series
autoplot(wmurders) + ylab('murders')
```
The murders time seriers does not seem to be stationary. We can notice a trend in this time series hence we must difference the data.

```{r}
# ACF and PACF plots of original time series
ggtsdisplay(murders$x, plot.type = 'partial')
```
```{r}
# ACF and PACF plots for first differenced time series
ggtsdisplay(diff(murders$x), plot.type = 'partial')
```
Since the lag 1 in ACF plot is negative and it displays a sharp cutoff, we consider adding MA term to the model. Since the autocorrelation becomes zero at fifth lag, the range of q is 1-5.
```{r}
# Choosing our model
fit1 <- Arima(murders$x, order = c(0,1,1))
summary(fit1)


fit2 <- Arima(murders$x, order = c(0,1,2))
summary(fit2)


fit3 <- Arima(murders$x, order = c(0,1,3))
summary(fit3)


fit4 <- Arima(murders$x, order = c(0,1,4))
summary(fit4)


fit5 <- Arima(murders$x, order = c(0,1,5))
summary(fit5)
```

Since Fit 2 has the lowest AICc and BIC, we choose p,d,q as (0,1,2)
A model with one order of differencing assumes that the original series has a constant average trend, hence a constant term should be included. Since our model is of order one, we must include a constant term.

```{r}
# Checking for residuals
fit <- Arima(murders$x, order = c(0,1,2))
checkresiduals(fit)
```
The residual plot looks like white noise, which means there is no information left in them, The ACF plot confirms this as there is no Auto-correlation between the residuals.This means that our model is satisfactory.Since the p value is high, we cannot reject null hypothesis which is that the series is white noise.
```{r}
#Generating forecasts
(forecast <- fit %>% 
             forecast(h = 3))
forecast %>% autoplot() + ylab('murders')
```
```{r}
 # let ARIMA() choose the model
auto <- auto.arima(murders$x, d = 1)
summary(auto)
```
The ARIMA has chosen (0,1,0). Since the model with pre existing p,d,q have lower AICc and BIC, that is a better model than the model that ARIMA has chosen
```{r}
 # Force run all combinations
auto_fit <- auto.arima(murders$x, d = 1, stepwise = FALSE, approximation = FALSE)
summary(auto_fit)
```
When we force run all the combinations,ARIMA selects (0,1,2), which is the model that we have chosen to be the best model as well.
